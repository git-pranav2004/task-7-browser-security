# Task 7 – Browser Extension Security

# Objective:
To identify potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions and understand how they can impact browser and data security.

# What I Did:
Opened Chrome's Extensions Manager.
Reviewed all installed extensions and checked their permissions.
Identified unused or suspicious extensions based on permission overreach and source credibility.
Removed 2 unnecessary extensions to improve performance and security.
Documented my learnings and prepared answers to relevant interview questions.

# Interview Q&A:

1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
Extensions can access everything you do online—some may steal data, inject ads, or download malware.

2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
Permissions like “Read and change all your data on websites,” background activity, and clipboard access should be carefully reviewed.

3. How to safely install browser extensions?
Install only from trusted sources like the Chrome Web Store, check reviews and permissions, and research the developer.

4. What is extension sandboxing?
It’s a browser security method that isolates extensions to prevent them from interfering with core browser functions or each other.

5. Can extensions steal passwords?
Yes. If given permission to read data on all websites, they can capture credentials entered into login forms.

6. How to update extensions securely?
Allow automatic updates via the official store. Avoid downloading .crx files manually from third-party sites.

7. Difference between extensions and plugins?

Extensions: Modify or enhance browser functionality.

Plugins: External software (like Flash) that handles content not natively supported by browsers.

8. How to report malicious extensions?
Visit the extension’s Chrome Web Store page, scroll to the bottom, and click “Report abuse.”
